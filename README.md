AI-Powered Task Management System Overview This is a full-stack AI-powered task management system built using Golang (Gin/Fiber) for the backend and Next.js (TypeScript + Tailwind CSS) for the frontend. The system enables real-time task tracking, JWT-based authentication, and AI-powered task recommendations. It is deployed on Render/Fly.io for the backend and Vercel for the frontend.

Note: The frontend depends on the backend API, so the backend is set up and running first. i am facing errors in the backend, they must be resolved before proceeding with frontend development Features User Authentication: Secure JWT-based authentication.

Task Management: Create, assign, update, and track tasks.

Real-Time Updates: WebSocket integration for instant task updates.

AI-Powered Suggestions: OpenAI/Gemini API integration for smart task breakdowns.

Cloud Deployment: Fully hosted on Render/Fly.io (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

High Performance: Golang's Gin/Fiber for speed and efficiency.

Scalability: PostgreSQL/MongoDB for data storage, Docker for containerization.
